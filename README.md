# Beyond Alignment: Discovering Cross-graph Triples for Knowledge Graph Integration

## Overview
This repository provides the benchmark datasets and the code will be made publicly available as soon as the work is published.

## Data 

**WIKI-YAGO**:  A Public dataset from  https://github.com/nju-websoft/CLP.
**DBP-FB**:  A Public dataset from  https://github.com/nju-websoft/CLP.

**ES-EN**: A novel benchmark constructed for the cross-graph triple prediction. 
**JA-EN**: A novel benchmark constructed for the cross-graph triple prediction. 

Here, we illustrate the files and folders contained in each benchmark. 

- KG1/KG2: Folders containing the triples (train.txt, valid.txt, test.txt) for each individual Knowledge Graph.
- cross: Folder containing the cross-graph information.
  - known_shared_entities.txt: List of known shared entities used for training.
  - cross_test.txt: List of cross-KG triples for testing.
  - all_shared_entities.txt: List of all shared entities between the KGs.



## Dataset Statistics

We provide the statistics of the benchmark datasets.
